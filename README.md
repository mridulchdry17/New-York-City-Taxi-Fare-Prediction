# New-York-City-Taxi-Fare-Prediction 

The goal of this project was to predict the fare amount for a taxi ride in New York City based on pickup and dropoff locations. By using advanced machine learning techniques, I reduced the RMSE error to $3.2, significantly improving on the basic model's RMSE of $7-$8. This demonstrates the effectiveness of sophisticated models like XGBoost in tackling complex prediction tasks.

Notably, I 
achieved this result using only 1% of the dataset to enhance computational speed, 
further demonstrating the power and efficiency of sophisticated models in handling 
complex prediction tasks.
